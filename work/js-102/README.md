# Matching Word Finder

## Due

Due 11:59pm, Sun Feb 4

## Assignment

* Don't forget to start from your master branch
* Don't forget to pull origin master
* Create a `js-102` branch
* In this directory (word/js-102/) you will edit the `guessing.js` file
* When run via `node guessing.js`, this will pick a random word and then try to guess it
* Do not edit the file just anywhere - there are 4 locations that say they can be edited
    * You will have to adapt to the existing logic of the program
    * Be careful that your editor doesn't change parts of the program you aren't trying to edit
    * You should fill in the functions as indicated
    * You MAY add functions (where indicated) that you call from the existing functions
* I strongly urge you to start with a very "dumb" system - the problem is more complex than it looks
* There is no requirement for high efficiency (see Extra Credit below)
    * The program has to run
    * It has to get the correct word
    * It has to get the correct count of similar letters
    * It has to run fast enough to be gradable (should not be a problem)
* Follow the advice given in class, in particular but not limited to:
    * Declare your variables
    * Use meaningful variable names
    * Write easy to read/follow/skip code
    * Use small functions
* You will have to look up additional functions/methods (I suggest MDN)
    * Built in JS functions will often be listed as part of a 'prototype' object
    * Example: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort     

## Submission

Push your `js-102` branch to github and create a pull request to merge with master

## Extra Credit 

Once you have a pull request working solution, you may:

* create a `js-102-extra` branch 
* copy the `guessing.js` file to `guessing-advanced.js`
* edit `guessing-advanced.js` as you did `guessing.js`
* Write the logic to minimize the number of guesses

Do not attempt this or spend time thinking about it until you have a "simple" solution working and submitted
